        <h1>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h1>

        <h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
        <p>
          We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on
          the Application to help customize the Application and improve your experience. When
          you access the Application, your personal information is not collected through the use of
          tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can
          remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and
          functionality of the Application. You may not decline web beacons. However, they can
          be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by modifying your web browser’s
          settings to notify you each time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline
          cookies on an individual basis.
        </p>
        <h2>Website Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We may also partner with selected third-party vendors, such as intelyse to allow
          tracking technologies and remarketing services on the Application through the use of
          first party cookies and third-party cookies, to, among other things, analyze and track
          users’ use of the Application, determine the popularity of certain content, and better
          understand online activity. By accessing the Application, you consent to the collection
          and use of your information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review
          their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not
          transfer personal information to these third-party vendors.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading
          an existing browser, or erasing or otherwise altering your browser’s cookies files may
          also clear certain opt-out cookies, plug-ins, or settings.
        </p>
        <h1>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
        <p>
          We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your
          personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal
          information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security
          measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be
          guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed
          online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we
          cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
        </p>
        <h1>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h1>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If
          you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please
          contact us using the contact information provided below.
        </p>
        <h1>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h1>
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems [and our mobile
          applications]include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal
          your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
          and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
          signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
          tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
          future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h1>OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
        <h2>Account Information</h2>
        <p>
          You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your
          account by:

            </li>
          </ul>
          Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account
          and information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained
          in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations,
          enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>Emails and Communications</h2>
        <p>
          If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from
          us, you may opt-out by: 
          <ul>
            <li>Contacting us using the contact information provided below
              admin@exlog-global.com</li>

          If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from
          third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly.
        </p>
        <h1>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h1>
        <p>

          our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and
          free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we
          disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of
          all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding
          calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request,
          please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided
          below.
        </p>

          If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account

          not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
